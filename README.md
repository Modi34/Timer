# Timer
Simple pomodoro timer for chromium

It does 3 things:
- A countdown for work and rest intervals.
- Plays sounds at the end of each cycle. "Mario coin" for work and "Attention on deck!" from stellaris for rest.
- Forces me to take a break by creating a window with a countdown and Apple TV Aerial screensaver.
