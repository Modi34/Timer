# Timer
Simple pomodoro timer for chromium

My favorite timer mac app stoped working and I was not able to find a good enough alternative so I decided to write my own.

It does 3 things:
- A countdown for work and rest intervals.
- Plays a sounds at the end of each cycle. "Mario coin" for work and "Attention on deck!" from stellaris for rest.
- Forces me to take a break by creating a window with a countdown and Apple TV Aerial screensaver.
