# Timer
Simple pomodoro timer for chromium

I needed a smiple timer for work because my fav macOs app stoped working.
Was not able to find a good enough alternative so I decided to write my own.
It is a chrome extension instead of macOs menubar app because I wanted it to be crossplatform.

Decided to share it because I really liked the way it turned out. Chrome storage observer api is awesome!

It does 3 things:
- A countdown for work and rest intervals.
- Plays a sounds on the end of each cycle. "Mario coin" for work and "Attention on deck!" from stellaris for rest.
- Forces me to take a break by creating a window with a countdown and Apple TV Aerial screensaver.
